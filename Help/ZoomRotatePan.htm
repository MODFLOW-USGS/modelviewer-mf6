<h1>Zooming, Rotation, and Panning</h1>

<p>
MvMf6 displays an object as viewed from a particular viewpoint.
Zooming, rotation, and panning are different ways
to interact with the object by changing the viewpoint.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Zooming in</b> moves the viewpoint closer to the object being viewed,
causing the object to appear bigger.
<li><b>Zooming out</b> moves the viewpoint away from the object being viewed,
causing the object to appear smaller.
<li><b>Rotation</b> moves the viewpoint in an angular direction so that the
viewed object appears to rotate.
<li><b>Panning</b> moves the viewpoint laterally so that the viewed object
appears to move sideways.
</ul>


<p>
Zooming, rotation, and panning are performed by mouse buttons. Two types of mouse interactions are provided:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="Trackball.htm">trackball-mode interaction</a>
<li><a href="Joystick.htm">joystick-mode interaction</a>
</ul>

<p>
Trackball-mode interaction is the default. However, the user may
<a href="ChangeInteractionMode.htm">change the interaction mode</a> from one to the other.
