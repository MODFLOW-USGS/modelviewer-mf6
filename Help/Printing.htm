<h1>Printing</h1>

<p>
The <A href="UserInterface.htm#display_area">display area</a> may be printed on a single page.
<ul>
<li>Click the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>Print Setup</b> to select 
the printer, paper size, orientation, and other printer properties.
<li>Click the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>Print Preview</b> to view 
the page as it would appear when printed. The display area is always 
scaled so that it will fit on one page.
<li>Click the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>Print</b> to print the page. Set the image 
  generation to coarse for low-resolution and faster printing. Set to fine for 
  higher resolution and slower printing. (See note below.)     
                      
</ul>
<P></P>

<h3>Note:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The resolution for image generation is independent of 
  the resolution of the printer. Even if the printer is set to print at high 
  resolution, the printed image will appear coarse if the image generation 
  resolution is set to coarse.
