<h1>Loading Modflow 6 Data</h1>


<p>
Model Viewer for MODFLOW 6 requires the <b>OC6</b> file be defined that sets the <b>HEAD FILEOUT</b> option to
view simulated heads and optionally the <b>BUDGET FILEOUT</b> to view vectors and model features.

loaded to <b><i>Model Viewer for Modflow 6</i></b> for visualization.
