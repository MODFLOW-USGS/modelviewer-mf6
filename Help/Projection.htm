<h1>Perspective Versus Parallel Projection</h1>

<p>
<ul>
<li>In perspective projection, parallel lines appear to converge to a point at 
infinity. This is the default projection mode.
<li>In parallel projection, parallel lines appear to remain parallel to each other 
as they extend to infinity. (Parallel projction is of limited usefulness in 
three-dimensional visualization, but can be used to "line up" cells or vectors.)
<li>To switch projection mode, Click the <b>Action</b> menu, select 
<b>Set Projection To</b>, and then select either <b>Perprective</b> or <b>Parallel</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Note:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Zooming is not synchronized between perspective and 
  parallel projection modes. The amount of zooming in one projection mode is 
  independent of the amount of zooming in the other projection mode.</li>                             
</ul>
