<h1>Lighting Toolbox</h1>

<p>
The <b>Lighting</b> toolbox allows adjustment of how graphic objects are illuminated.
The default lighting provided by MvMf6 is a <b>headlight</b>, which illuminates
objects from the direction of the viewpoint. <u>The default setting is adequate for
most cases, and lighting adjustment is often unnecessary</u>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>If the <b>Lighting</b> toolbox is not visible, display it by clicking
the <b>Toolbox</b> menu and selecting <b>Lighting</b>.
<li>Clicking <b>Default</b> will
  assign default settings to the selected tab. Default settings are given in
  parentheses below.


<li>The <b>Lights</b> tab allows you to:
    <ul>
    <li>Turn on the headlight by checking the <b>Headlight</b> option. (By default,
    the headlight is turned on.)
    <li>Turn off the headlight by unchecking the <b>Headlight</b> option.
    <li>Set the headlight intensity. (1)
    <li>Turn on the auxiliary light by checking the <b>Auxiliary Light</b> option.
    <li>Turn off the auxiliary light by unchecking the <b>Auxiliary Light</b> option. (By default,
    the auxiliary light is turned off.)
    <li>Set the auxiliary light intensity. (0)
    <li>Set the vector direction from which the auxiliary
    light illuminates graphic objects. The vector components (x, y, z) may vary
    from -1 to 1. For example, if x=

          0, y=

           0, z= 1, the
      auxiliary light will shine from the positive z axis towards the negativez axis.&lt; /li&gt;&lt; /li&gt;< /li>

    </ul>

<li>The <b>Surface</b>  tab allows you to set the surface properties
of graphic objects. These properties are:
    <ul>
    <li>Diffuse: This parameters is currently not adjustable and is set to 1.0.
    <li>Ambient: Increasing this parameter above 0 gives
    surfaces a "washed out" appearance and reduces the shading. Setting this
    parameter to the maximum value of 1 causes surfaces to appear white. (0)
    <li>Specular: The amount of reflected light. (0)
    <li>Specular Power: The surface shininess. (1)</li>
    </ul>

<li>The <b>Background</b> tab allows you to:
    <ul>
    <li>Set the background color to white by selecting the <b>White</b> option. (White
    is the default background color.)
    <li>Set the background to any color by by selecting the <b>Custom</b> option and the specifying the red, green,
    and blue components of the color.</li>
