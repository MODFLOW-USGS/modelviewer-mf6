<h1>Vector Data</h1>

<h3>To show or hide vector data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click the <b>Show</b> menu and select <b>Vector</b>. This alternately shows or hides the
  vectors.</li>

</ul>

<li>MvMf6 displays a vector as a line oriented in the direction of the vector.
The length of the line is proportional to the vector magnitude or, if choosen by the user, the logarithm of the ratio of the vector magnitude to the smallest vector magnitude.
(<A href="Toolbox_Vector.htm">How to control vector display</a>)

<li>The starting point of the vector is the center of a cell.
A small cube (called the <b>base</b>) may be displayed at the starting point.

<li>Note: Showing all vectors in the grid may result in a very cluttered picture.

<li>For models with structured discretization (DIS grid) , vectors can be displayed for a selected range of i, j, and k indices
of the grid or cropped i the same way as scalar data may be cropped. In addition, the vector data may be "subsampled" by showing every n-th vector (n &gt;  1) along the i, j, and k directions.

<li>Thresholding may be applied to display only those
  vectors having magnitudes within a specified range.
