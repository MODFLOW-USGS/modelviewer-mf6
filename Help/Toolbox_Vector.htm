<h1>Vector Toolbox</h1>

The <b>Vector</b> toolbox controls the <A href="VectorData.htm">display of vector data</A>.
<P></P>

<ul>
<li>If the <b>Vector</b> toolbox is not visible, display it by clicking
the <b>Toolbox</b> menu and selecting <b>Vector</b>.
<li>Clicking <b>Default</b> will
  assign default settings to the selected tab. Default settings are given in
  parentheses below.

<li>The <b>Subsample</b> tab allows you to display a subset of vectors.
    <ul>
    <li>The subset of vectors is defined by the minimum value (<b>Min</b>), maximum value (<b>Max</b>),
    and the sampling <b>rate</b> for the i, j, and k indices. For example,
    if Min = 3, Max = 20, and Rate = 4 for index i, then vectors will be displayed at i values
    of 3, 7, 11, 15 and 19. (By default, Min, Max and Rate are set to show all vectors.)
    <li>You may also click the <b>up or down arrow</b> to increase or decrease the Min or Max values.</li>
    For SUTRA models with irregular meshes, only the k rate is active and the nodes throughout the mesh will be subampled based on their node numbers.
    </ul>

<li>The <b>Appearance</b> tab allows you to:
    <ul>
    <li>Set the <b>Scale Factor</b>
    for the vectors. (<a href="#note1">See note 1 below.</a>)
    Check of uncheck the Log Transform option to either apply a log transformation to the ratio of the vector to the smallest vector or to use the vector magnitudes without transformation.
    <li>Check or uncheck the <b>Show Base</b> option to show or hide small cubes
    at the starting point of each vector.
    <li>Check the up or down arrow to increase or decrease the size of the base cubes.
    <li>Set the vector color to black, gray, or white.
    (black)</li>
    </ul>

<li>The <b>Threshold</b> tab allows you to:
    <ul>
    <li>Check the <b>Apply Threshold</b> option to display only those vectors having magnitudes within
    the threshold range.
    <li>Uncheck the <b>Apply Threshold</b> option to turn off thresholding.
    <li>Specify the minimum and maximum vector magnitudes
    to define the threshold range.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li >The Crop tab allows you to:</li>
   <UL>
   <LI>  Select which vectors are displayed using a <a href="Toolbox_Crop.htm">cropping procedure similar to that used to crop isosurfaces or solids</a>.</LI>
   </UL>

</ul>

<h3>Note</h3>

<ol>
<a name="note1"></a><li>When model data are loaded, MvMf6
computes a default scale factor based on the maximum vector magnitude
at the selected time to display data. The actual value of the
scale factor is unimportant. To lengthen the vectors, simply increase
the scale factor. To shorten the vectors, decrease scale factor.
