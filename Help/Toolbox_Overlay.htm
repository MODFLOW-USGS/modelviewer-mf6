<h1>Overlay Toolbox</h1>

<p>
The <b>Overlay</b> toolbox is used to import an <a href="Overlay.htm">overlay</a>
contained in either an ESRI Shapefile or a DXF file.</p>
<p>To import an overlay:

<ol>
<li>If the <b>Overlay</b> toolbox is not visible, display it by clicking 
the <b>Toolbox</b> menu and selecting <b>Overlay</b>.

<li>Click the <b>File</b> tab.

<li>Select the <b>Type</b> of file (ESRI Shapefile or DXF file) to be imported.

<li>Click the <b>Browse</b> button and navigate to the  
file you want to import. Double click the file.

<li>Click the <b>Controls</b> tab.

<li>Enter the following information:

  <ul>
   <li><b>X0</b> and <b>Y0</b> are the x and y coordinates in the overlay file
   (that is, the Shapefile or DXF file) of the point that coincides with 
   the lower left corner of the grid, when the grid is viewed from directly above.

   <li><b>Scale</b> is the conversion factor that converts the length
   unit used in the overlay file to the length unit of the model
   grid. For example, if the overlay file data are in meters, 
   and the grid is in feet, then "scale" should be 3.2808.

   <li><b>Angle</b> is the angle in degrees to rotate the overlay. 
   A positive value cause rotation in the clockwise direction.
   </ul>

<li>Next, select either:
   <ul>
   <li><b>Flat</b>  : The overlay is displayed on a flat plane, or
   <li><b>Drape</b> : The overlay is displayed on the top of the grid.
   </ul>

<li>If you select <b>Flat</b> then:
    
    <ul>
    <li>Enter a value for <b>Elev</b>, which is the elevation (in length
    unit used by the grid) of the plane on which the overlay is displayed.

    <li>If you check the <b>Trim</b> option, the overlay will be trimmed 
    so that any portion outside the grid (when viewed from directly 
    above) is removed. If you activate the subgrid (using the 
    Grid Toolbox), then the overlay will be trimmed to the subgrid.

    <li>If you uncheck the <b>Trim</b> option, the entire overlay will be 
    displayed. (Even if you activate the subgrid, the overlay will 
    not be trimmed.)
    </ul>

<li>If you select <b>Drape</b> then:

<ul>
    <li>The <b>Trim</b> option is automatically turned on and cannot be 
    turned off. This is necessary because the program doesn't know 
    how to drape the overlay for those portions outside the grid. 
    Therefore, any portion of the overlay outside the grid (or subgrid) 
    is removed.

    <li>You may want to raise the overlay slightly above the top of 
    the grid. This can be done by specifying the <b>drape gap</b>. 
    When the drape gap is zero, the overlay is exactly on the top 
    surface of the grid. If you set the drape gap to 1.5, the overlay 
    is 1.5 length units (whatever length unit used in the model) above 
    the top surface of the grid. (In solid display, the overlay 
    should be slightly above the top of the grid so that the grid 
    does not partially cover the overlay.)
</ul>

<li>If desired, select <b>Crop</b>:
<UL>
   <LI>If the you click the <b>Crop</b> option, portions of the overlay are removed so that the overlay appears only above the cropped solid.</LI>
</UL>

<li>Click the <b>Apply</b> button.
</ol>
