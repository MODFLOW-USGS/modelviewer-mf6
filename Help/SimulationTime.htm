<h1>Simulation Time</h1>

<p>To alternately show or hide the simulation time, click the <b>Show</b> menu
and select <b>Time</b>.

<ul>

<li>The simulation time is displayed near the lower left corner of the 
<A href="UserInterface.htm#display_area">display area</a>
  <P></P>

<li>    The time unit is that assumed in the model.

<li>For MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-96, the stress period and time step
  are shown in parentheses after the simulation time.

<li>For MODFLOW-2000 GWT and MOC3D:

  <ul>
  <li>If concentration results are save in a formatted (text or ASCII) file, then the stress 
  period, time step, and particle move are shown in parentheses after the simulation time.
  
  <li>If concentration results are save in an unformatted (binary) text file, then the stress period, 
  and time step are shown in parentheses after the simulation time. The particle move is not shown
  because it is not saved.
  </ul>


<li>For MOC3D, the stress period, flow time step, and
  transport move are shown in parentheses after the simulation time.
  
<li>For SUTRA, the time step is shown in parentheses 
  after the simulation time.</li></ul>
