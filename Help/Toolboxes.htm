<h1>Toolboxes</h1>

<p>
MvMf6 provides a number of small dialog boxes,
call <b>toolboxes</b>, for controlling specific aspects of the display.
</p>

<ul>
<li> The <b>Toolbox</b> menu provides commands to show or hide the toolboxes.

<li>A check mark next to a command indicates that the corresponding toolbox is shown.
Selecting this command will hide the toolbox.

<li>The absence of a check mark next to a command indicates that the corresponding toolbox
is hidden. Selecting this command will show the toolbox.

<li>Each toolbox may be closed by clicking <b>Done</b>.

<li>Toolboxes do not have to be closed for the program to continue.

<li>Except for text entries, all controls on toolboxes will take effect immediately
when changed. (The only exception is the Particles Toolbox.)

<li>For text entries, the user must click <b>Apply</b> to apply the change.


</ul>
