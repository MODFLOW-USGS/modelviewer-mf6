<h1>Solid</h1>

<ul>
<li> When scalar data are represented as a solid, all active cells in the
  grid are colored by mapping scalar values to the color bar.

<li>Inactive cells, if present in the grid, are excluded.


<li>Because the solid is rendered as opaque, only the
  exterior surface is visible.

<li>The interior of the solid can be examined by
<A href="Threshold.htm">thresholding</A> and
<A href="Cropping.htm">cropping.</A></li>

</ul>

<p>
<a name="coloring_schemes"></a>MvMf6 provides 3 <b>coloring schemes</b>:
(<A href="Toolbox_Solid.htm">How to specify the coloring scheme</A>)</p>

<ul>
<li><a name="blocky"></a><b>Blocky:</b> Each cell has a uniform color according to the
  nodal value for that cell. This scheme is available only for finite-difference
  models (such as MODFLOW) but not for finite-element models (such as SUTRA).</li>






</ul>

<ul>
<li><a name="smooth"></a><b>Smooth:</b> Nodal values are interpolated to yield scalar
  values that vary smoothly from one node to another. Consequently, the colors
  vary smoothly through the solid.</li>





</ul>

<ul>
<li><a name="banded"></a><b>Banded:</b> The solid is divided by isosurfaces into a
  discrete number of bands. Each band has a uniform color.</li>
