<h1>Cropping</h1>


<ul>

<li>Cropping is a method for exploring a <A href="Solid.htm">solid</A>
or a set of <A href="Isosurface.htm">isosurfaces</A> by showing only that portion
  that lies on one side of a cropping plane. (<A href="Toolbox_Crop.htm">How to crop</A>)


<li>MvMf6 implements three pairs of cropping
  planes, denoted as the x, y, and z.


<li>By default, the pair of x cropping planes is
  perpendicular to the x axis, and similarly for the y and z cropping planes.


<li>However, the x and y cropping planes may also be
  rotated.


<li>When cropping is enabled, only the portion between a pair
  of cropping planes is displayed.


<li> The locations of the pair of x cropping planes, in
  their unrotated state, are specified as x =
    value1 (Min position) and x =  value2 (Max  position), where value1
  is less than or equal to value2. The locations of the pair of y and z cropping
  planes are specified similarily. Note that the x, y, and z axes are
  normalized to range from 0 to 1. <li>




</ul>



<p>
The figure below illustrates cropping a solid using the
pair of y cropping planes at y =

  0.3 (Min position) and y =     0.7

         (Max position).
