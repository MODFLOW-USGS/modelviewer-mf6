<h1>Animation Toolbox</h1>


The <b>Animation</b> toolbox controls the display 
of model results at successive times to create an animation.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the <b>Animation</b> toolbox is not visible, display it by clicking 
the <b>Toolbox</b> menu and selecting <b>Animation</b>.

<li>The <b>Controls</b> tab allows you to do the following:
    <ul>
    <li >To choose whether the animation will advance through time or change the viewpoint without advancing through time, set the <b>Animation type</b> to &quot;time&quot; or &quot;viewpoint.&quot;</li>
     <li >If the animation type is set to &quot;viewpoint&quot; you can set the <b>Number of steps</b> in the animation.</li>
    <li>To advance to the next time or position, click <b>Advance</b>.
    <li>To run an animation (continuously advance to the next time), click <b>Run</b>.
    <li>To stop a animation, click <b>Stop</b>.
    <li>To set the display to a particular time, select that time 
    from the drop-list box, and then click <b>Set</b>.
    </ul>


<li>The <b>Options</b> tab allows you to do the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Specify a <b>Delay</b> (in seconds) between successive times. This will slow down
    the animation. To animate at the fastest speed, specify a delay of zero.

    <li>Specify an angle increment to <b>Rotate</b> (horizontally) the viewpoint 
    between between successive times.

    <li>Specify an angle increment to <b>Elevate</b> (vertically) the viewpoint 
    between between successive times.

    <li>For a stationary viewpoint during animation, enter 0 in the Rotate and Elevate text boxes.
    </ul>
    
</ul>
