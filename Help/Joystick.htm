<h1>Joystick-Mode Interaction</h1>

<p>
In 
joystick-mode interaction, the speed and direction of zooming, rotation, and 
panning are determined by the position of the cursor relative to the center 
of the <a href="UserInterface.htm#display_area">display area</a>. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>When the cursor is far from the center, interaction is faster.  
<li>When the cursor is near the center of the display area, interaction is slower.  
<li>To <b>zoom in</b>, place the cursor on the upper half of the display area, then 
press and hold the <b>right</b> mouse button. To end zooming, release the button. 
<li>To <b>zoom out</b>, place the cursor on the lower half of the display area, then 
press and hold the <b>right</b> mouse button. To end zooming, release the button. 
<li>To <b>rotate</b>, place the cursor such that its position relative to 
the display area center indicates the direction of rotation, then press and hold 
the <b>left</b> mouse button. To end rotation, release the button. 
<li>To <b>rotate around an axis perpendicular to the screen</b>, place the cursor such that its position 
relative to the display area center indicates the direction of rotation, then press and 
hold the <b>Ctrl</b> key and left mouse button. To end rotation, release the button.
<li>To <b>pan</b>, place the cursor such that its position relative to the display area 
center indicates the direction of panning, hold down the <b>Shift</b> key,
