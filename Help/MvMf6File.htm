<h1>The mvmf6 File</h1>

<ul>
<li>The <b>mvmf6 file</b> is used by <b><i>Model Viewer for Modflow 6</i></b> to keep track
of the model data and display settings for a particular set of
simulation results (model run). This file has a name
that ends with <b><i>.mvmf6</i></b>.

<li>The <b>New</b>, <b>Open</b>, <b>Close</b>, <b>Save</b> and
<b>Save As</b> commands (under the <b>File</b> menu) operate on mvmf6 files.

<li>The <b>New</b> command begins the process of creating a new mvmf6 file.
You will be asked to <A href="LoadMf6Data.htm">load model data</A>.

<li>When you <b>save</b> an mvmf6 file, <b><i>Model Viewer for Modflow 6</i></b> writes the following
information to disk: the name(s) of model data files
and all current display settings. Note that the mvmf6 file does not contain the
actual model data.

<li>The mvmf6 file must be save to the folder containing the "name" file.

<li>When you <b>open</b> an mvmf6 file, <b><i>Model Viewer for Modflow 6</i></b> loads the model data and sets
the display according to the information saved in the mvmf6  file.

<li>When you <b>close</b> an mvmf6 file, <b><i>Model Viewer for Modflow 6</i></b>  terminates the display of data.
The program window becomes blank. The Close command is useful during repeated
cycles of running a model and viewing the results. While model results are
displayed in Model Viewer, the model data files cannot be over-written
by another program. Closing the mvmf6 file releases the model data files
so that the model can run to generate a new set of results.

<li>Every time you change a display setting (for example, the
  color bar limits), the current mvmf6 file is considered to have been changed. If
  you did not saved the mvmf6 file after the changes, and you try to (a) create a
  new mvmf6 file, or (b) close the current mvmf6 file, or (c) exit <b><i>Model Viewer for Modflow 6</i></b>, you
  will be prompted to save the mvmf6 file before continuing.</li>
