<h1>Assuming All Active Cells</h1>

<ul>
<li>The last item under the <b>Action</b> menu is the <b>Advanced</b>
submenu, which contains the <b>Assume All Active Cells</b> command.

<li>For <b>finite-difference</b> models (MODFLOW-2000, MODFLOW-2000 GWT, 
MODFLOW-96, MOC3D, and MT3DMS), if all cells in the model grid are active, 
invoking this command can speed up calculations required for graphical 
rendering.

<li>However, if the model grid contains inactive cells, this command should 
not be invoked. Otherwise, inactive cells will be displayed as active.

<li>For the <b>finite-element</b> model SUTRA, all cells are active, so this
command is disabled.

</ul>
