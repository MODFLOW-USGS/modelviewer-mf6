<h1>Particles Toolbox</h1>

The <b>Particles</b> toolbox controls the <A href="Particles.htm">display of particles</a> for
MODFLOW 2000-GWT or MOC3D simulations.

<ul>
<li>If the <b>Particles</b> toolbox is not visible, display it by clicking 
the <b>Toolbox</b> menu and selecting <b>Particles</b>.       

<li>The text boxes in the <STRONG>Crop</STRONG> section allow you show only 
  those particles in a subregion defined by the cropping planes, which are similar
  to the <a href="Cropping.htm">cropping planes for solid and isosurfaces</a>. You may
    <ul>
    <li>Specify the <b>Min</b> and <b>Max</b> positions of the x, y, and z cropping planes.
    (Min = 0, Max = 1)
    <li>Specify the <b>Delta</b> value, which is used to increase or decrease the 
    Min or Max position when the up or down arrow is clicked. (0.1)
    </ul>
  <b>Important Note:</b> Cropping does not go into effect when the up or down arrow is
  clicked. You must click <b>Apply</b>.</li>

<li>The edit boxes in the <b>Threshold</b> section allow you to show only those particles having 
concentrations within the threshold range. To apply thresholding:
    <ul>
    <li>Specify the minimum and maximum values of the threshold range.
    <li>Click <b>Apply</b>            
    </ul>
<li>The <b>Full</b> button sets the minimum and maximum values of the threshold range
  respectively to the minimum and maximum particle concentrations at the current time
step.

<li>Particle size may be increased or decreased by clicking the up or down arrow next to the label "Size".
</ul>
