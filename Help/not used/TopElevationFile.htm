<h1>Top Elevation File</h1>

<p>
Because the MOC3D input data do not contain the top elevation
of the model grid, an extra text file is needed to supply this
data for Model Viewer. This file is known as the <b>top elevation file</b>.
</p>


<p>
The top elevations must be supplied in MODFLOW 2D array reader format. 
</p>

<p>
For example, if the top elevation is a constant value of 100, the 
the top elevation file would contain one line:
</p>

<xmp>
constant   100.0
</xmp>
