<h1>The x-y-z Axis System</h1>



<P>For <b>finite-difference</b> models (MODFLOW-2000,
  MODFLOW-2000 GWT, MODFLOW-96, MOC3D, and MT3DMS), the x-y-z axis system is not
  explicitly defined by the models. MvMf6 defines the axes as follows:
  </P>

<ul>
<li>The positive x axis is oriented along a row of cells and points in the direction of increasing
column numbers, as defined in MODFLOW. (See figure below.)
<li>The positive y axis is oriented along a column of cells and points in the direction of decreasing
row numbers, as defined in MODFLOW. (See figure below.)
<li>The positive z axis points vertically upward.</li>
</ul>
<UL></UL>

<p>For the <b>finite-element</b> model SUTRA, MvMf6 uses
  the same the x, y, and z axis system as that defined in the input data.</p>

<h3><a name="normalized_coord">Normalized Coordinates</a></h3>

<ul>
<li> For ease of spatial reference and orientation,
  MvMf6 normalizes the x, y, and z coordinates with respect to the bounding box. (Normalized coordinates are used to specify the positions of
cropping planes and the axes symbol.)
<li>The bounding box is the smallest box that contains all active cells.
The edges of the bounding box are aligned with the x-y-z axis system.
<li>The x, y, and z coordinates take on 0 or 1 at the
  corners of the bounding box, as shown below.</li>
</ul>
