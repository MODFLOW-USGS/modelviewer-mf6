<h1>MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-2005 Data Requirements</h1>

<p>
Date requirements for visualizing MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-2005 results are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The input parameters 
<A href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(hnoflo,PopupFont,9,9,-1,-1)">HNOFLO</A> and 
<A href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(hdry,PopupFont,9,9,-1,-1)">HDRY</A> must be 
assigned values that are different 
from simulated heads at active cells. (<A href="#note1">See note 1 below.</a>)
<li>Simulated <b>heads</b> (for all 
  model layers) must be saved to file at one or more stress periods/time steps. The
head file may be formatted or unformatted. (<A href="#note2">See note 2 below.</a>) 
For a formatted file, the input parameter 
<A href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(chedfm,PopupFont,9,9,-1,-1)">CHEDFM</A>
in the output control (OC) file should include the word LABEL. 
<li>To view <b>drawdown</b> results, 
  drawdown (for all model layers) must be saved to file <u>at the 
same stress periods/time steps as the saved heads</u>. The drawdown file may be formatted
or unformatted. (<A href="#note2">See note 2 below.</a>) For a formatted file, the input parameter 
<A href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(cddnfm,PopupFont,9,9,-1,-1)">CDDNFM</A> 
in the output control (OC) file should include the word LABEL.
<li>To view <b>compaction</b> simulated by the Interbed Storage (IBS) Package, compaction must be saved to file 
<u>at the same stress periods/time steps as the saved heads</u>. Note that the compaction file 
generated by MODFLOW-2000 is unformatted.
<li>To view <b>critical heads</b> simulated by the IBS package, critical head must be saved to file 
<u>at the same stress periods/time steps as the saved heads</u>. Note that the critical head 
generated by MODFLOW-2000 is unformatted.
<li>To view <b>specific discharge</b> vectors, cell-by-cell flow 
  terms for the Block-Centered Flow (BCF) Package, Layer-Property Flow (LPF) Package, 
  or Hydrologic-Unit Flow (HUF) Package must be saved to file <u>at the same stress 
  periods/time steps as the saved heads</u>. The cell-by-cell flow data may be 
  in compact or noncompact form. Cell-by-cell flow terms for other packages may 
  be saved to the same file. Model Viewer will ignore these data. Note that the 
  cell-by-cell flow file generated by MODFLOW-2000 is unformatted.</li>        
              
            
                           
</ul>
              
<h3>Notes:</h3>

<ol>
<a name="note1"></a><li>If the simulated head at a cell is equal to either
HNOFLO or HDRY, Model Viewer assumes that the cell is inactive and will not
display it. Therefore, the common practice of setting HNOFLO or HDRY to 
zero should be avoided if heads at active cells might also be zero. Another 
consideration is to avoid truncation error. For example, setting HNOFLO 
to 99.999 should be avoided because the output might not be written with 
adequate precision. Instead, it is recommended that HNOFLO and HDRY be set 
to large negative integer values such as <nobr>-1.0E10</nobr> and <nobr>-2.0E10</nobr>.
<a name="note2"></a><li>Model Viewer reads unformatted files much more 
  quickly than formatted files. Therefore, for a faster animation, the head file 
  (and drawdown file, if saved) should be unformatted.</li>           
             
             
</ol>
