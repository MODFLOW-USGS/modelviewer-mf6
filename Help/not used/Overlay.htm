<h1>Overlay</h1>

<ul>
<li>MvMf6 1.1 can import a line drawing to be displayed as an "overlay" on
the top surface of a grid or above the grid.
(<A href="Toolbox_Overlay.htm">How to import an overlay</a>)
<li>The line drawing must be contained in either an ESRI Shapefile or a DXF file.
However, not all entities in a DXF file are supported. The following DXF entities are
displayed: line, polyline, circle, arc, and text.
<li>As illustrated below, the overlay may be "draped" on the top
surface of the grid (left figure), or displayed as a flat drawing above the grid (right figure).
</ul>

<h3>To show or hide the overlay (after it has been imported)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click the <b>Show</b> menu and select <b>Overlay</b>. This
alternately shows or hides the overlay.
