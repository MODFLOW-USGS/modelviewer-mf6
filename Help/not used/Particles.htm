<h1>Particles</h1>

<p>This options is available only for MODFLOW 2000-GWT and MOC3D.</p>
<h3>To show or hide particles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click the <b>Show</b> menu and select <b>Particles</b>. This
alternately shows or hides the particles.
<li>Particles are displayed as small cubes. Showing all particles in the grid may result in a very cluttered picture. 
To avoid this, particles may be limited by cropping and thresholding. The figure below
shows particles in the top portion of a grid.

particles display</a>) 
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Each particle is colored according to the solute concentration associated with the particle. 
The color is determined by mapping the concentration to the <a href="ColorBar.htm">color bar</a>. 
<li>Cropping may be applied to show only 
  those particles in a specified subregion of the grid.           
<li>Thresholding may be applied to show only 
  those particles having concentrations within a specified range.           
</ul>
