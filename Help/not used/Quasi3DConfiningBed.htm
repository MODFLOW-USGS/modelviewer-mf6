<h1>Treatment of Quasi-3d Confining Bed</h1>

<ul>
<li>MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-96 allow for the presence of a
quasi-3d confining bed below a model layer. This confining bed
is not counted in the layer index. Hydraulic head and drawdown
are not explicitly computer in the confining bed.

<li>In Model Viewer, a quasi-3d confining bed is counted
explicitly as a layer. Hydraulic head (and drawdown, if simulated)
in the layer is obtained by linear interpolation using the values
in the overlying and underlying aquifer layers.

<li>The figure below shows the layer indexing convention used
in MODFLOW and in Model Viewer.
