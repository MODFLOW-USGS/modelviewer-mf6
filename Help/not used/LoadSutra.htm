<h1>   Loading SUTRA (Version 2.2, 2.1, and 2.0) Data</h1>

<p>Before loading data, please check that the "nod", "ele" (if used), and "inp" files
are all in the same folder.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>New</b>.
<li>If changes to the previous MV document have not been saved, a dialog box is displayed
that allows you to click: <b>Yes</b> to save changes or <b>No</b> to discard changes.
<li>The Model Selection dialog box is displayed. Select <b>  SUTRA&nbsp;</b> from the
drop-list box, and then click <b>OK</b>. 
<li>The SUTRA Data File dialog box is displayed. Specify the "nod" file
in the first text box by clicking the corresponding <b>Browse</b> button and
  navigating to the file. (<A href="#note1">See note 1 below.</A>)
<li>If velocity data have been saved in an "ele" file, it can optionally
be specify in the second text box by using the corresponding <b>Browse</b> button.
Otherwise, leave the text box blank.
<li>Specify the SUTRA input data file ("inp" file) third text box by using
the corresponding <b>Browse</b> button. 
<li>Click <b>OK</b>.
<li>A dialog box gives you the option to convert the text files to binary files.
If you click <b>No</b>, Model Viewer will read from the nod, ele, and imp files specified
above. If you click <b>Yes</b>, will convert the data in these files into binary and
save them to a binary file. You will be prompted to supply the name of this file, which
should end with <b><i>.bin</i></b>. After conversion, the program will read 
  data from the binary file. The original text files are not modified. 
  Conversion to binary format is recommended because Model Viewer can read from 
  a binary file much faster than from a text file.      
              
<li>The Data Selection dialog box is displayed. From the 
  drop-list boxes, select the time step and data type for the initial display. (Note
that the number in parentheses indicates the time step.) Then click <b>OK</b>.</li>
               
      
</ol>


<p>
After the model data are loaded, the opening display will be a 
grid outline viewed from overhead (from +z axis toward -z direction) at the selected 
time in Step 9 above.
</p>

<p>Scalar values (for example, pressure, concentration, etc.) at the selected time are 
used to set the <A href="ColorBar.html">color bar</A> as follows:
<ul>
<li>Red represents the maximum scalar value.
<li>Blue represents the minimum scalar value.
<li>However, if scalar values are uniform over the grid, 
  then red represents s+1, and blue represents s-1, where s is the uniform 
  scalar value.
  <P></P></li></ul>

<p>If velocity data (in the ele file) were loaded in Step 5, then velocity vectors
are scaled so that, for the selected time, the length of the vector with the 
highest magnitude is approximately one-tenth the diagonal distance across the 
<A href="AuxiliaryGraphicalObjects.htm">bounding box</A>.
              
<h3>Note:</h3>

<ol>
<a name="note1"></a><li>If you want to load a previously created binary file,
you may specify it in the first text box using the <b>Browse</b> button. 
Then, click <b>OK</b>.&nbsp;In this case, it is not necessary to specify 
  the nod, ele, or inp files.</li>
