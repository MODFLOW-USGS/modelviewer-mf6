    <h1>Loading MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-2005 Data</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>New</b>.
      </li>
      <li>If changes to the previous MV document have not been saved, a
        dialog box is displayed
        that allows you to click: <b>Yes</b> to save changes, or <b>No</b>
        to discard changes.
      </li>
      <li>The Model Selection dialog box is displayed. Select <b>MODFLOW-2000/2005</b>
        from the
        drop-list box, and then click <b>OK</b>.
      </li>
      <li>The MODFLOW-2000/2005 Data File dialog box is displayed.
        Specify the "name" file in the first text box by clicking the
        corresponding <b>Browse</b> button and navigating to the
        file.
      </li>
      <li>If pathlines have been calculated by MODPATH, the pathline
        file may be optionally entered into the second text box by using
        the corresponding <b>Browse</b> button. Note that the pathline
        file must be in the same folder as the "name" file. If pathlines
        were not calculated,&nbsp;leave
        the text box blank. Check the checkbox for backwards particle
        tracking if backwards particle tracking was used. Some pathline
        files indicate whether forwards or backwards particle tracking
        was used. For those files, the direction specified in the file
        will be used.</li>
      <li>If you wish to display data from an <a
          href="file:///D:/Mv/mv_branch2/Help/ExternalFileFormat.htm">external
          file</a>, specify the name of the <a
          href="file:///D:/Mv/mv_branch2/Help/ExternalFileFormat.htm">external
          file</a>. The <a
          href="file:///D:/Mv/mv_branch2/Help/ExternalFileFormat.htm">external
          file</a> must be in the same folder as the "name" file. If an
        <a href="ExternalFileFormat.htm">external file</a> is not
        used,&nbsp;leave the text box blank. </li>
      <li>If the model has generated binary (unformatted) output data,
        the specify
        the <a href="BinaryDataType.htm">type of binary data</a> from
        the drop-list box.
        If no binary data are generated, ignore this step. </li>
      <li>Click <b>OK</b>. </li>
      <li>The Data Selection dialog box is displayed. From the drop-list
        boxes, select the time and data type for the initial display.
        (Note that the numbers in
        parentheses indicate the stress period and time step.) Then
        click <b>OK</b>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      After the model data are loaded, the opening display will be a
      bounding box viewed from overhead (from +z axis toward -z
      direction) at the selecte time in Step 8 above.
    </p>
    <p>Scalar values (for example, heads, drawdown, etc.) at the
      selected time are used to set the <a href="ColorBar.html">color
        bar</a> as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red represents the maximum scalar value.
      </li>
      <li>Blue represents the minimum scalar value.
      </li>
      <li>However, if scalar values are uniform over the grid, then red
        represents s+1, and blue represents s-1, where s is the uniform
        scalar value.
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If cell-by-cell flow data are available, then the specific
      discharge vectors
      are scaled so that, for the selected time, the length of the
      vector with the highest magnitude is approximately one-tenth the
      diagonal distance across the <a
        href="AuxiliaryGraphicalObjects.htm">bounding box</a>.</p>
