<h1>Moving Model Data Files</h1>

<p>After running a model, if you want to move model data files (input and output) 
into another folder, you should be aware of the following requirements.

<ul>
<li>For MODFLOW-2000, MODFLOW-2000 GWT, MODFLOW-96, MOC3D, you should ensure that
after the data files are moved, if you run the same model again:
    <ul>
    <li>The run will execute without error.
    <li>All the new output files will be identical to the previous output files. 
    <li>Every new output will be generated in the folder 
    where the previous output file is currently located.</li>          
             
    </ul> 

<li>For MT3DMS, the model configuration file ("cnf"), unformatted concentration file ("ucn"), 
and flow-transport link file ("ftl") must all be in the same folder.

<li>For SUTRA, the "nod", "ele", and "inp" 
  files must all be in the same folder.</li>                

</ul>
