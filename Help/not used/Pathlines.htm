through the model domain.
<li>A pathline may be displayed as a line or a narrow tube.

pathline display</a>) 
<li>The pathline is colored by using a red-to-blue spectrum to 
indicate a range of travel time. Either red or blue may serve as the early 
time. Travel times outside the range are clamped to the corresponding endpoint color. 
<li>Thresholding may be applied to show only 
  those pathline segments for which the travel time is within a specified range.
