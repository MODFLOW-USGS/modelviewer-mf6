<h1>Loading MODFLOW-96 Data</h1>

<ol>
<li>Click the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>New</b>.
<li>If changes to the previous MV document have not been saved, a dialog box is displayed
that allows you to click: <b>Yes</b> to save changes, or <b>No</b> to discard changes.
<li>The Model Selection dialog box is displayed. Select <b>MODFLOW-96</b> from the
drop-list box, and then click <b>OK</b>. 
<li>The MODFLOW-96 Data File dialog box is displayed. Specify the "name" file in the 
first text box by clicking the corresponding <b>Browse</b> button and navigating to the
file.
<li>Specify the <A href="LayerElevationFile.htm">layer elevation file</A> in the 
second text box by using the corresponding <b>Browse</b> button.
<li>If pathlines have been calculated by MODPATH, the 
  pathline file may be optionally entered into the third text box by using the 
  corresponding <STRONG>Browse</STRONG> button. Note that 
  the pathline file must be in the same folder as the "name" file. If pathlines 
  were not calculated, leave
the text box blank.
<li>If the model has generated binary (unformatted) output data, the specify
the <A href="BinaryDataType.htm">type of binary data</A> from the drop-list box. 
If no binary data are generated, ignore this step. 
<li>Click <b>OK</b>. 
  
<li>The Data Selection dialog box is displayed. From the 
  drop-list boxes, select the time and data type for the initial display. (Note that the numbers
in parentheses indicate the stress period and time step.)&nbsp;Then click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
After the model data are loaded, the initial display will be a 
bounding box viewed from overhead (from +z axis toward -z direction) at the selected 
time in Step 9 above.
</p>

<p>Scalar values (for example, heads, drawdown, etc.) at the selected time are 
used to set the <A href="ColorBar.html">color bar</A> as follows:
<ul>
<li>Red represents the maximum scalar value.
<li>Blue represents the minimum scalar value.
<li>However, if scalar values are uniform over the grid, 
  then red represents s+1, and blue represents s-1, where s is the uniform 
  scalar value.
  <P></P></li></ul>

<p>If cell-by-cell flow data are available, then the vectors specific discharge vectors
are scaled so that, for the selected time, the length of the vector with the 
highest magnitude is approximately one-tenth the diagonal distance across the 
<A href="AuxiliaryGraphicalObjects.htm">bounding box</A>.</p>
