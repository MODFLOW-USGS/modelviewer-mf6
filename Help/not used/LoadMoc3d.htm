<h1>Loading MOC3D (Version 3.5) Data</h1>

<ol>
<li>Click the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>New</b>.
<li>If changes to the previous MV document have not been saved, a dialog box is displayed
that allows you to click: <b>Yes</b> to save changes, or <b>No</b> to discard changes.
<li>The Model Selection dialog box is displayed. Select <b>MOC3D (Version 3.5)</b> from the
drop-list box, and then click <b>OK</b>. 
<li>The MOC3D Data File dialog box is displayed. Specify the "name file" in the 
first text box by clicking the corresponding <b>Browse</b> button and navigating to the
file.
<li>Specify the <A href="TopElevationFile.htm">top elevation file</A> in the 
second text box by using the corresponding <b>Browse</b> button.
<li>If pathlines have been calculated by MODPATH, the 
  pathline file may be optionally entered into the third text box by using the 
  corresponding <STRONG>Browse</STRONG> button. Note that 
  the pathline file must be in the same folder as the "name" file. If pathlines 
  were not calculated, leave
the text box blank.
<li>If the model has generated binary (unformatted) output data, the specify
the <A href="BinaryDataType.htm">type of binary data</A> from the drop-list box.
If no binary data are generated, ignore this step.  
<li>Click <b>OK</b>. 
  
<li>The Data Selection dialog box is displayed. From the 
  drop-list boxes, select the time for the initial display. (Note that the numbers in parentheses indicate the stress period,
time step, and particle move.) Then click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
After the model data are loaded, the opening display will be a 
bounding box viewed from overhead (from +z axis toward -z direction) at the selected 
time in Step 9 above.
</p>

<p>Concentrations at the selected time are used to set the <A href="ColorBar.html">color bar</A> as follows:
<ul>
<li>Red represents the maximum concentration.
<li>Blue represents the minimum concentration.
<li>However, if concentrations are uniform over the grid, 
  then red represents c+1, and blue represents c-1, where c is the uniform 
  concentration.
  <P></P></li></ul>

<p>If velocity data are available, then velocity vectors
are scaled so that, for the selected time, the length of the vector with the 
highest magnitude is approximately one-tenth the diagonal distance across the 
<A href="AuxiliaryGraphicalObjects.htm">bounding box</A>.</p>
