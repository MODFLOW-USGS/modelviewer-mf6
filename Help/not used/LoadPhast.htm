<h1>Loading PHAST Data</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    Click the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>New</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    If changes to the previous MV document have not been saved, a dialog box is displayed
    that allows you to click: <b>Yes</b> to save changes, or <b>No</b> to discard changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Model Selection dialog box is displayed. Select <b>Phast HDF</b> from the
    drop-list box, and then click <b>OK</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Phast Data File dialog box is displayed. Specify the HDF file in the
    text box by clicking the corresponding <b>Browse</b> button and navigating to the
    file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <b>OK</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Data Selection dialog box is displayed. From the
    drop-list boxes, select the time and data type for the initial display.
    Then click <b>OK</b>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
After the model data are loaded, the opening display will be a
bounding box viewed from overhead (from +z axis toward -z direction) at the selected
time in Step 6 above.
</p>

<p>Scalar data (for example, heads, concentrations, etc.) are displayed by selecting
solid or isosurface from the Show menu. Scalar values at the selected time are
used to set the <A href="ColorBar.html">color bar</A> as follows:
<ul>
<li>Red represents the maximum scalar value.
<li>Blue represents the minimum scalar value.
<li>However, if scalar values are uniform over the grid,
  then red represents s+1, and blue represents s-1, where s is the uniform
  scalar value.
  <P></P></li></ul>

<p>Vector data are displayed by selecting Vectors from the Show menu.  If nodal
velocity data are available, then the velocity vectors are scaled so that, for
the selected time, the length of the vector with the highest magnitude is
approximately one-tenth the diagonal distance across the
<A href="AuxiliaryGraphicalObjects.htm">bounding box</A>.</p>
